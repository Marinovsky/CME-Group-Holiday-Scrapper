You are a data extraction agent.

TASK:
1. Search the official CME Group website for the "CME Group Holiday Calendar 2026".
2. Extract the holiday, early close, late open, and bank holiday schedules for all asset classes available.
3. Produce a JSON file that has EXACTLY the SAME STRUCTURE as the reference schema described below.
4. The values (dates and times) MUST correspond to the year 2026.
5. DO NOT reuse any dates or times from the example year.
6. If a category has no data for a given field, return an empty object {} or empty array [] as appropriate.

REFERENCE STRUCTURE (structure only, not values):
- Top-level keys represent asset classes (e.g. equity, interest, fx, crypto, energy, metals, grains, dairy, livestock, lumber, softs).
- Each asset class contains:
  - exchangeTimeZone (string)
  - earlyCloses (object: "M/D/YYYY" → "HH:MM:SS")
  - lateOpens (object: "M/D/YYYY" → "HH:MM:SS")
  - holidays (array of "M/D/YYYY")
  - bankHolidays (array of "M/D/YYYY")

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output MUST be valid JSON.
- Dates MUST use format: M/D/YYYY (no leading zeros).
- Times MUST use format: HH:MM:SS (24-hour clock).
- Do NOT include comments, explanations, markdown, or extra text.
- Return JSON only.

SOURCE REQUIREMENT:
- Use only information found on CME Group official webpages.
