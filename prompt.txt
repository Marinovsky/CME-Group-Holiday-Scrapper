You are a financial market calendar expert specializing in CME Group futures.

Generate a CME Futures holiday trading calendar in JSON format.

Requirements:
- Exchange: CME Group (Globex)
- Instrument type: Futures only
- Timezone: Central Time (CT)
- Years: 2026
- Granularity: Asset class level

Asset classes to include:
- Equity Index
- Interest Rates
- FX
- Crypto
- Energy
- Metals
- Agriculture:
  - Grains
  - Livestock
  - Dairy
  - Lumber

For EACH holiday and EACH asset class, explicitly specify:
- status:
  - "Closed"
  - "Early Close"
  - "Shortened Trading"
  - "Normal Trading"
- close_time (HH:MM:SS or null if closed all day)
- open_time (HH:MM:SS or null if closed all day)
- notes (short explanation, e.g. "Early close before holiday", "Reopens Sunday evening")

Rules:
- Use official CME Globex holiday schedules and standard CME trading-hour conventions.
- Early closes must reflect realistic CME times (e.g., equities 12:00 CT, energy 13:30 CT, FX/Crypto 16:00 CT when applicable).
- If a market is closed for the entire holiday, both open_time and close_time must be null.
- If trading resumes in the evening for the next trade date, include that reopen time.
- Dates must use ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD.
- Times must use 24-hour format HH:MM:SS.
- Output VALID JSON only.
- Do NOT include explanations outside the JSON.

Additional constraints:
- Always include all asset classes even if the schedule is identical.
- Do not omit holidays.
- Do not guess unusual schedules; follow standard CME conventions.
- Keep field names consistent across all objects.
- Ensure JSON is strictly valid and parseable.
